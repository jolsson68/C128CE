Commodore 128 Community Edition PCB

Project status: I am right now working on the PCB in DipTrace, using the CorelDRAW images as guide to lay traces, components, vias, board outline and cutouts. As soon as I have completed the net list (all traces laid in both signal layers) I will add the project files in the repository.

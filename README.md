# C128CE
Commodore 128 Community Edition PCB

Project status: I am right now working on the PCB in DipTrace, using the CorelDRAW images as guide to lay traces, components, vias, board outline and cutouts. As soon as I have completed the net list (all traces laid in both signal layers) I will add the project files in the repository.

While working in DipTrace, I have encountered a few small mistakes (missing traces) in the CorelDRAW images, so I update them every now and then as I go. Keep an eye out for new commits. :-)
